# In short, there are three scenarios to this selection statement;
# 1) A standard number that is 12 digits or less, which should cover all cases in regards to the current nutrition use case,
# 2) A alternative option if there an extremely large number with 13 to 30 digits, which should be highly unlikely.
# 3) A final catch-all case, to tie up any number that isn't covered by the last two options.
